## My process
I First build the structure using HTML5 markup
then added style with CSS (cutom proerties and Grid), with interactivity.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Was very good reinforicing building HTMl structure , I still have problem with css style . Needed to review some code about how to center and control the size of elements.
I have started using grid to control the layout of the page like this :
```CSS
.card-btn{
    display: grid;
    gap: 0.75rem;
    place-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development
I need to work on layouts and CSS styling. this is the most important area I need to work in

### Useful resources
I can't say enough about kevin powel channel in youtube, it has the best lession in CSS , especially since he foucus on vanila CSS , and his teaching style is easy and to the point.
- [His channel ](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Highly recommend his series about Grid and Flexbox.
